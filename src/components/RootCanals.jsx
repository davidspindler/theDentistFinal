   Root canal treatment is a common and highly successful procedure. It is essential to seek prompt dental
care if one experiences symptoms such as severe toothache, swelling, or sensitivity, as these may
indicate the need for a root canal. Sometimes the longevity of the saved tooth is also taken into
consideration to evaluate other options. The dentist will evaluate your specific situation and discuss the
best treatment options for your oral health.
