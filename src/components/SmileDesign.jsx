        <h1>Smile Design</h1>
        <p>Smile design or smile makeover is a cosmetic dental procedure that focuses on creating a beautiful and
natural-looking smile that complements your facial features. It harnesses various cosmetic and
restorative dental procedures and also addresses any functional or oral health concerns. It&#39;s not just
about getting straight teeth; it&#39;s about considering the shape, size, color, and alignment of your teeth in
relation to your lips, gums, and overall facial aesthetics.</p>
