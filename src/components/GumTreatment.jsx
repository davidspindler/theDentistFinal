    description: `Gum treatment, also known as periodontal treatment, is a set of procedures aimed at preventing,
    diagnosing, and treating conditions that affect the gums and supporting structures of the teeth.
    Periodontal diseases are bacterial infections that can range from mild gum inflammation (gingivitis) to
    more severe conditions like periodontitis, which can lead to tooth loss if left untreated. There is also the
    problem of receding gums where the roots of the teeth are exposed.`,

            description: `For individuals with more advanced gum disease, a deep cleaning procedure
            called scaling and root planing may be recommended. It involves removing plaque and tartar from
            below the gumline and smoothing out the roots of the teeth to promote healing.`,

            include flap surgery to lift and clean beneath the gums, bone and tissue (gum) grafts to regenerate lost
            structures, and pocket reduction surgery to reduce the depth of gum pockets.`,
